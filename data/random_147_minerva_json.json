At 15:45, the number 10^18 appears, but this is smaller than the number shown at 13:07. This ends up being the largest number in the video and -12 ends up being the smallest number.

            "reasoning": "I began watching the video and noticed they discussed a bunch of constants. These constants varied. At 00:50, a number of 3.3598856662 was shown. At 01:42, I saw the number 137.5. At 02:51 I was the number -2.89. At 06:03, the number 3263442 was shown. At 11:31, many numbers flash across the frame, with variables attached to them. The smallest number from that page was -12. At 11:54, the number 01101001100101101001011001101001 is shown. At 13:07, the number 1221121221221121122121121 is shown. At 13:40, the number  4113101149215104800030529537915953170486139623539759933135949994882770404074832568499 is shown. At 15:45, the number 10^18 appears, but this is smaller than the number shown at 13:07. This ends up being the largest number in the video and -12 ends up being the smallest number. I added those 2 numbers together and then divided the result by 100000000000 to get 4.11 x 10^{73}. Therefore, if we add the largest number shown in the video to the smallest number shown in the video and divide them by 100000000000, the result rounded to 2 decimal points is 4.11 x 10^{73}.",

I also noticed a message pop up to notify players of the orange player's 3-troop bonus \"for occupying 7 territories\" at 02:15. Therefore, I determined that the game had begun. I heard the host say \"I am in the fourth position\" at 02:17. I noticed that there was a vertical stack of six players on the right side of the screen and the player in red was fourth from the top. There was also a small text bubble that read \"YOU\" beneath the red player's avatar. I also noticed that the orange player was on the top of the stack, making them the first position. At 02:38 I heard the host identify the first position player as \"Booker Freedom 9\". I watched as the host clicked on Booker Freedom 9's avatar and scrolled down to view their stats from 02:39-02:41. I read four different statistics from this section: Games played, Hours played, Online games won and lost, and Play Friends games won and lost. Since the question asked for the percentage of online games won, I first found the total number of online games played by adding 398+793=1191. Then I divided 398/1191=0.3341.

Then I read a line of text that said \"Starting Game...\" at 02:12. Then, I saw the gameboard appear at 02:14. I also noticed a message pop up to notify players of the orange player's 3-troop bonus \"for occupying 7 territories\" at 02:15. Therefore, I determined that the game had begun. I heard the host say \"I am in the fourth position\" at 02:17. I noticed that there was a vertical stack of six players on the right side of the screen and the player in red was fourth from the top. There was also a small text bubble that read \"YOU\" beneath the red player's avatar. I also noticed that the orange player was on the top of the stack, making them the first position. At 02:38 I heard the host identify the first position player as \"Booker Freedom 9\". I watched as the host clicked on Booker Freedom 9's avatar and scrolled down to view their stats from 02:39-02:41. I read four different statistics from this section: Games played, Hours played, Online games won and lost, and Play Friends games won and lost. Since the question asked for the percentage of online games won, I first found the total number of online games played by adding 398+793=1191. Then I divided 398/1191=0.3341. Then I multiplied by 100 to convert the figure into a percent: 0.3341*100=33.41%.",

At 02:18, I paused the video and counted how many players there were. Based on the hands I saw in the frame, there are 4 players. Then, I counted how many players had a red card in their hands and noticed all the players had at least 1 red card.

I identified this as a racing number by the fact that it looked like an identifying yellow sticker, placed on the side of the bike for the race and not as a part of the paint job or sponsorships.

Then, I watched this player's last shot attempt from 01:47-01:52. The shot was taken close to the basket and inside the 3-point line, so it is a 2-point attempt. At 01:53, I saw the final score, which would've been 62-62 if Aja Wilson had made her last shot. Therefore, the game would have been tied if the shot went in.",
